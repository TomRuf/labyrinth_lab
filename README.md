### description: 
labyrinths are wonderful little puzzles that can be used to show what algorithms are, how they work, 
and that different algorithms have different strenghts and weaknesses. in a current research and 
design project, we are creating MOOC units for parts of the »ways of thinking in informatics course«. 
for computational thinking, this bachelorproject designs and implements a »labyrinth lab«, where students 
can experiment with algorithms in labyrinths. eg. it should be possible to see how different algorithms 
solve different labyrinths, follow the execution of the algorithm debugger-style through the labyrinth, 
and maybe even construct individual labyrinths for the algorithms to solve.
